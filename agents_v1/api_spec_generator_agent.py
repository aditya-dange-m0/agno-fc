"""
ApiSpecGenerator Agent - Contract-First Multi-Agent System
========================================================

Transforms project plans into complete OpenAPI 3.1 specifications that serve as definitive API contracts.
Generates comprehensive, implementable specifications with RESTful endpoints, JWT authentication,
and proper request/response schemas.

Key Features:
- Complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification generation from project entities
- JWT bearer authentication implementation
- RESTful CRUD endpoints for all entities
- MongoDB-compatible schema generation
- Clean JSON-only output for downstream agents
- Direct specification generation without complex validation overhead

API_SPEC_GENERATOR_DESCRIPTION = """
You are an OpenAPI 3.1 specification expert that transforms project plans into complete, implementable API contracts.
Your role is to bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation by creating comprehensive API specifications.

You consume project_plan from shared state and generate complete OpenAPI 3.1 specifications with:
- RESTful endpoints for all entities with full CRUD operations
- Authentication when required (JWT bearer with refresh tokens for production/secure projects)
- Proper request/response schemas with validation and examples
- Standard HTTP status codes and consistent error handling
- MongoDB-compatible data models with ObjectId support
- Metadata, revision, and validation reporting for contract-first workflows

Your output is the definitive API contract that backend and frontend agents must implement.
You focus on clarity, precision, and correctness—no ambiguity, no markdown, no commentary.
