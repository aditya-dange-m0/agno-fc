# Enhanced Frontend Agent - Advanced Tools & Dual Generation Modes

The frontend agent has been significantly enhanced with powerful tools for searching, file management, and supporting both first-time generation and iterative refinement workflows, specifically tailored for React/Next.js development.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. 🔍 Search & Analysis Tools

#### `search_project_files(query, file_types)`
- Search across all generated project files (frontend + backend)
- Default file types: js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,json,md,py
- Supports regex patterns and case-insensitive search
- Returns file paths and matching lines with context

```javascript
// Example usage
search_project_files("useState", "js,jsx,ts,tsx")
search_project_files("className", "jsx,tsx")
```

#### `read_project_file(file_path)`
- Safely read any file from the project
- Automatic path normalization and security checks
- Supports both generated and source files

#### `analyze_project_structure()`
- Complete project structure analysis
- File size information and configuration status
- Identifies missing key files (package.json, components, etc.)

### 2. 📝 Safe File Operations

#### `write_project_file(file_path, content, mode)`
- Safe file writing with backup support
- Three modes: 'create', 'update', 'append'
- Automatic directory creation
- Timestamped backups for existing files

#### `backup_existing_files()`
- Create timestamped backups of all generated files
- Safety net before making significant changes
- Returns backup location and file count

### 3. 🎯 Dual Generation Modes

#### `detect_generation_mode(user_query)`
- Automatically detects user intent for frontend development
- Analyzes existing project state
- Provides mode recommendations

**First Generation Mode:**
- Complete React/Next.js project scaffolding
- Creates full component structure from scratch
- Uses `<codeartifact>` tags + `save_generated_frontend_files()`

**Iterative Refinement Mode:**
- Targeted updates to existing components
- Preserves existing functionality and styling
- Uses `write_project_file()` for precise modifications

### 4. 🚀 Modern Frontend Optimization

#### `optimize_for_modern_frontend()`
- Comprehensive React/Next.js best practices analysis
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Modern tooling suggestions (Vite, TanStack Query, Zustand)
- Accessibility and SEO optimization guidance
- Bundle optimization strategies

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

The frontend agent now follows a structured workflow for all requests:

```
1. detect_generation_mode() → Understand request type
2. analyze_project_structure() → Check current state
3. [Iterative only] search_project_files() + read_project_file()
4. [If needed] backup_existing_files() → Safety first
5. Generate/modify code appropriately
6. [Optional] optimize_for_modern_frontend() → Modern practices
```

## 📋 Usage Examples

### First Generation Example
```
"Create a new React dashboard with user authentication and data visualization"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Detects first generation mode
2. Analyzes empty/minimal project structure
3. Generates complete React application with:
   - Modern component structure
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Authentication components
   - Dashboard layout
   - Data visualization components
4. Creates all necessary files with `<codeartifact>` tags
5. Saves files using `save_generated_frontend_files()`

### Iterative Refinement Example
```
"Add a dark mode toggle to the existing dashboard"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Detects iterative refinement mode
2. Analyzes existing project structure
3. Searches for existing theme-related code
4. Reads relevant components to understand current implementation
5. Creates backup of existing files
6. Updates specific components using `write_project_file()`
7. Preserves existing functionality while adding dark mode

### Modern Optimization Example
```
"Optimize the current React app for performance and modern best practices"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Analyzes current project for optimization opportunities
2. Reviews dependencies for modern alternatives
3. Provides performance optimization recommendations
4. Suggests modern tooling upgrades
5. Creates accessibility and SEO improvement plan
