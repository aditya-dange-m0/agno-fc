### 5. 🤝 Enhanced Team Coordination (Orchestrator)
- **`detect_project_mode()`** - Team-level mode detection and coordination
- **`analyze_team_project_structure()`** - Comprehensive team project analysis
- **`backup_team_project()`** - Team-wide backup management
- **Enhanced Workflow Logic** - Supports both first generation and iterative workflows
- **Intelligent Request Processing** - Natural language understanding for development requests

### 6. 📚 Enhanced Documentation & Testing
- **Comprehensive READMEs** - Complete usage guides for both backend agent and orchestrator
- **Test Suites** - Validation of all new functionality (backend + orchestrator)
- **Code Comments** - Clear documentation of new workflows and tools

## 🔄 New Workflow Process
