# Enhanced Backend Agent - Advanced Tools & Dual Generation Modes

The backend agent has been significantly enhanced with powerful tools for searching, file management, and supporting both first-time generation and iterative refinement workflows.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. 🔍 Search & Analysis Tools

#### `search_project_files(query, file_types)`
- Search across all generated project files (frontend + backend)
- Supports regex patterns and case-insensitive search
- Configurable file type filtering
- Returns file paths and matching lines with context

```python
# Example usage
search_project_files("FastAPI", "py,js,jsx")
search_project_files("async def", "py")
```

#### `read_project_file(file_path)`
- Safely read any file from the project
- Automatic path normalization and security checks
- Supports both generated and source files

#### `analyze_project_structure()`
- Complete project structure analysis
- File size information and configuration status
- Identifies missing key files

### 2. 📝 Safe File Operations

#### `write_project_file(file_path, content, mode)`
- Safe file writing with backup support
- Three modes: 'create', 'update', 'append'
- Automatic directory creation
- Timestamped backups for existing files

#### `backup_existing_files()`
- Create timestamped backups of all generated files
- Safety net before making significant changes
- Returns backup location and file count

### 3. 🎯 Dual Generation Modes

#### `detect_generation_mode(user_query)`
- Automatically detects user intent
- Analyzes existing project state
- Provides mode recommendations

**First Generation Mode:**
- Complete project scaffolding
- Creates full FastAPI structure from scratch
- Uses `<codeartifact>` tags + `save_generated_files()`

**Iterative Refinement Mode:**
- Targeted updates to existing code
- Preserves existing functionality
- Uses `write_project_file()` for precise modifications

### 4. 🚀 Edge Function Optimization

#### `optimize_for_edge_deployment()`
- Comprehensive edge deployment analysis
- Dependency optimization recommendations
- Cold start optimization strategies
- Production readiness checklist
- Deployment configuration generation

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

The agent now follows a structured workflow for all requests:

```
1. detect_generation_mode() → Understand request type
2. analyze_project_structure() → Check current state
3. [Iterative only] search_project_files() + read_project_file()
4. [If needed] backup_existing_files() → Safety first
5. Generate/modify code appropriately
6. [Optional] optimize_for_edge_deployment() → Production ready
```

## 📋 Usage Examples

### First Generation Example
```
"Create a new FastAPI backend for a task management system with user authentication"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Detects first generation mode
2. Analyzes empty/minimal project structure
3. Generates complete FastAPI application
4. Creates all necessary files with `<codeartifact>` tags
5. Saves files using `save_generated_files()`

### Iterative Refinement Example
```
"Add a new endpoint to handle task comments in the existing backend"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Detects iterative refinement mode
2. Analyzes existing project structure
3. Searches for existing task-related code
4. Reads relevant files to understand current implementation
5. Creates backup of existing files
6. Updates specific files using `write_project_file()`

### Edge Optimization Example
```
"Optimize the current backend for Vercel edge function deployment"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Analyzes current project for edge compatibility
2. Reviews dependencies for edge-friendly alternatives
3. Provides cold start optimization recommendations
4. Generates deployment configurations
5. Creates production readiness checklist

## 🛠️ Production-Ready Features

### Edge Function Optimizations
- **Cold Start Optimization**: Connection pooling and lifespan management
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Analysis and recommendations for lighter alternatives
- **Environment Configuration**: Production vs development settings
- **Health Checks**: Lightweight monitoring endpoints

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **First Generation**: Simply describe your backend requirements
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Describe specific changes to existing code
3. **Edge Optimization**: Ask for edge deployment analysis
4. **Production Deployment**: Use generated configurations for your platform

The enhanced backend agent automatically detects your intent and follows the appropriate workflow, ensuring clean, modular, and production-ready code every time.

## 🔧 Configuration

The agent uses the same configuration as before but now includes additional tools:

```python
tools=[
    save_generated_files,           # Original file generation
    get_project_plan,              # Team coordination
    update_backend_status,         # Status updates
    get_development_status,        # Development tracking
    search_project_files,          # 🆕 File search
    read_project_file,             # 🆕 File reading
    write_project_file,            # 🆕 Safe file writing
    analyze_project_structure,     # 🆕 Project analysis
    detect_generation_mode,        # 🆕 Mode detection
    backup_existing_files,         # 🆕 Backup creation
    optimize_for_edge_deployment   # 🆕 Edge optimization
]
```

This enhanced backend agent provides a complete solution for both initial development and ongoing maintenance of FastAPI applications, with special focus on edge function deployment and production readiness.
