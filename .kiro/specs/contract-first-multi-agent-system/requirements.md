# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a lean, contract-first multi-agent system with an Orchestrator managing workflow and shared state. The system follows a strict flow: Planner → ApiSpecGenerator → Backend → Frontend → Validation → Iteration, ensuring contract integrity and automated code generation.
see current implementation [here](/agents)(/main.py)(/enhanced_playground.py)
Cretate new folder for agents and tools naming convention: `/agent-v1` or `/tool-v1` and naming as `agent_name.py` or `tool_name.py`

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Orchestrator to coordinate agent handoffs and manage shared state, so that the workflow executes reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the Orchestrator SHALL initialize shared state and coordinate agent execution order
2. WHEN an agent completes its task THEN the Orchestrator SHALL trigger the next agent in the workflow
3. WHEN managing shared state THEN the Orchestrator SHALL ensure agents only access their designated input/output keys
4. WHEN workflow errors occur THEN the Orchestrator SHALL handle failures and coordinate recovery
5. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the Orchestrator SHALL provide final status and generated artifacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Planner Agent to transform user requests into structured project plans, so that downstream agents have clear business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving user input THEN the Planner Agent SHALL generate project_plan JSON with business goals, features, entities, and API surface
2. WHEN specifying auth policy THEN the system SHALL always use jwt_with_refresh
3. WHEN defining tech stack THEN the system SHALL always use React+TS+Tailwind, FastAPI, MongoDB
4. WHEN the plan is complete THEN it SHALL write to shared state key `project_plan`
5. WHEN generating output THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON only with no Markdown or comments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ApiSpecGenerator Agent to create OpenAPI specifications from project plans, so that all code generation follows a strict contract.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving project_plan THEN the ApiSpecGenerator SHALL consume only this input and generate complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification
2. WHEN creating the specification THEN it SHALL include schemas, endpoints, JWT bearer security, and status codes (201, 400, 401, 404)
3. WHEN validation completes THEN it SHALL include validation_report in the output
4. WHEN the spec is complete THEN it SHALL write to shared state key `api_spec`
5. WHEN generating output THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON only with no Markdown or comments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Backend Agent to generate FastAPI code that strictly conforms to the API specification, so that there is no contract drift.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating backend code THEN the Backend Agent SHALL consume only api_spec from shared state If needed can also get project plan
2. WHEN creating routes THEN they SHALL match exactly the OpenAPI paths, methods, and schemas
3. WHEN implementing authentication THEN it SHALL use JWT bearer token validation as specified
4. WHEN generating responses THEN they SHALL conform to specified schemas and status codes
5. WHEN generating output THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON only with no Markdown or comments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Frontend Agent to generate React+TS+Tailwind code that matches the API specification, so that integration is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating frontend code THEN the Frontend Agent SHALL consume only api_spec from shared state also If needed can also get project plan
2. WHEN creating API calls THEN they SHALL match request/response schemas from the OpenAPI specification
3. WHEN building UI components THEN they SHALL handle all specified status codes appropriately
4. WHEN implementing authentication THEN it SHALL use JWT bearer tokens as specified
5. WHEN generating output THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON only with no Markdown or comments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation and iteration capabilities (future iteration), so that contract drift can be detected and corrected automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is implemented THEN the Validator SHALL check backend/frontend compliance against api_spec
2. WHEN drift is detected THEN the validation_report SHALL be updated with specific issues
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the Orchestrator SHALL coordinate Planner/ApiSpecGenerator regeneration
4. WHEN specs are updated THEN Backend/Frontend agents SHALL regenerate code against new contracts
5. WHEN iteration occurs THEN api_spec SHALL remain the single source of truth

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strict agent separation of concerns, so that each agent has clear responsibilities and no overlap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Planner operates THEN it SHALL never generate OpenAPI specification details
2. WHEN the ApiSpecGenerator operates THEN it SHALL never invent business requirements beyond the project_plan
3. WHEN Backend/Frontend agents operate THEN they SHALL never modify the api_spec
4. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use only designated shared state keys
5. WHEN any agent generates output THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON only with no Markdown or comments
